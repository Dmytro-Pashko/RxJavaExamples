# RxJava2 Samples 
===
My samples of using RxJava2 during study Reactive Programming based on book: 
 **"Reactive Programming with RxJava Creating Asynchronous, Event-Based Applications"**
by Ben Christensen, Tomasz Nurkiewicz.

> “This book is a deep dive into the concepts and uses of RxJava in particular, and reactive
programming in general, by authors who have countless hours of experience
implementing and using RxJava in the real world. If you want to go reactive, there is no
better way than to buy this book.”

> “RxJava is an invaluable tool for managing the highly stateful, concurrent, and
asynchronous implementations that a modern Android application requires. This book
serves as both an incremental learning tool and a reference for a library, which can
otherwise be quite daunting to fully understand.”
